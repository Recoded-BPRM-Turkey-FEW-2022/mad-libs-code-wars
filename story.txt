Our solar system is made up of the Sun and all of the[a] objects that move around it. There are eight[a] planets in our solar system. Closest to the Sun are four smaller,[a] planetsâ€”Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Beyond Mars is the asteroid
belt, a region populated by millions of rocky[n]. Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, but are much smaller than planets. After
the asteroid belt, there are two gas giants, [a] and Saturn, and two ice giants, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter
and Saturn are much [a] than Earth, but very [a] for their size. Scientists are learning new
things about our [a] planets all the time. We
send sacecraft to take [n], gather ,[n] and find out more about them.
